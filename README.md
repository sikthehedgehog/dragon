# Dragon's Castle

> In what used to be a peaceful town, a fearsome dragon has appeared and has brought horror and become a threat to everybody. Merlina, a young witch, has decided to take the matter on her hands and has gone into the castle where the dragon resides to get rid of it and bring peace back to her people.

This is the source code to Dragon's Castle. One of the big things from this code is that you can try using it to make *your own* platformer game, and not have to cope with all the ugly details, like limitless two-way scrolling or slope physics. (well sorta, the engine could use some more flexibility and was designed only with small rooms instead of large stages)

**Currently the exact license for this code hasn't been decided yet, so if you want to use this for your own game feel free to contact me for arranging something. I'll definitely keep this at the very least compatible with the GPL, however!**

## How to play

You can get a prebuilt ROM by downloading the `witch.bin` file (make sure to choose "raw view" so the browser downloads it!).

The default controls (can be changed from the Options menu) are:

* **D-pad:** move
* **A button:** magic
* **B button:** attack
* **C button:** jump
* **Start button:** pause

Jump and attack are self-explanatory. Magic is a different kind of attack which gives you more points but it's a bit more risky to use. Currently magic doesn't work on every enemy (this will improve as development progresses).

You can reset the game by pressing A+B+C while paused.

### Options menu

* **Difficulty:** affects the behavior of some hazards.
* **Sound test:** lets you listen to the sounds in the game.
* **Controls:** changes the button mappings.

Note that the difficulty setting currently isn't respected by everything that should do it ;)
